# BookReservationSystem
This PHP-based web application is tailored for managing book reservations in a library setting. Users can register, log in securely, and perform searches by book title, author, or category to find available books. 

They have the capability to reserve books that are not already reserved by others and manage their reservations effectively. The system incorporates server side validation to maintain data integrity and offers pagination for search results, presenting up to 5 books per page

The application uses MySQL for storing data and PHP for handling server side operations. It features a user friendly interface designed with CSS for easy navigation and usability.
